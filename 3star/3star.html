            <p><em>This is an advanced exercise! You may not finish it during the practical session.</em></p>
            <p>Try implementing noughts and crosses using a 2D array to represent the board. You can make it a two player 
                game or let the user play against the computer. If you're not familiar with noughts and crosses, 
                <a href="https://g.co/kgs/RF55xyb" target="_blank">play it online</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This is no check file for this exercise.</p>
            <p>Example output (try to make yours look better!):</p>

                    <p>Start by breaking the task down into it's component parts and tackle the 
                        simplest first. For example, try drawing a 3 x 3 grid for the board. Then, 
                        figure out how you will represent where the "X"s and "O"s are placed. You 
                        will need a 2D array, but you'll need to figure out what to put in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The two player implementation (where you act as both players) is easier to 
                        implement than an AI opponent, even if your AI is as dumb as in the example.
