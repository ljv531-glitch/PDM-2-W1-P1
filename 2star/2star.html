    <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p><em>The focus of this exercise is two dimensional arrays.
            </em></p>
            <p>Open sketch.js. It contains JSDoc for four functions that perform operations 
                on 2 dimensional arrays. Your task is to 
                implement the functions as specified in the jsDoc. Write the function 
            immediately below the JSDoc. Take a look at the example code from Lecture 1 for help with 2D array syntax.</p>
            <p>There will not be any output on the sketch (unless you choose to make some). Run 
                the check file to unit test your function implementations. 
            </p>

                    <p>If the tests are failing, first make sure that your function signature (it's name, arguments, and return type) match 
                        the JSDoc exactly. Remember, function names are case sensitive. The JSDoc tells you exactly what sort of data 
                        each function is expecting and what type of data should be returned. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you're sure your implementation matches the JSDoc, then you probably have a logic issue. Look closely at the failing 
                        tests. They will tell you what the function was called with and what output was expected. Then, trace your 
                        implementation to find the bug.
